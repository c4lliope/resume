experiences << Experience.new('Carbon Cash, LLC', 'Dec 2013 - Jun 2014', 'API Designer & Developer',

"Carbon Cash is a Michigan-based startup that rewards students for good energy
usage habits. I designed and implemented an API that supported iOS, Android, and
client-side Ember web apps, and in addition handled hosting and server maintenance.
The system was built on with Rails, and integrated with local power companies and
university housing systems to retrieve data about students' energy usage.")


experiences << Experience.new('Bitlab, MSU', 'Oct 2012 - Mar 2014', 'Web Developer & Research Assistant',

"Led by Rick Wash, the BitLab at MSU is studying economic trends of crowdfunding
sites. As part of the project, the team has built a crowdfunding site for use by
MSU students that collects valuable data about how people interact in a
crowdfunding marketplace. As the sole developer working on an existing code base,
I was responsible for redesigning the site, setting up automated testing, running
usability studies, and integrating the site with Amazon Payments.")


experiences << Experience.new('Eurucamp 2014', 'Aug 2014', 'Conference Talk: Service-Oriented Architecture',

"Based on a client project, I created and delivered a live-coded presentation to
introduce people to Service-Oriented Architecture. Designed to help developers
break their first service out of a monolithic application, the talk covered
inter-process messaging protocols, alternative data stores, and lightweight web
frameworks", 'Community')


experiences << Experience.new('ACM at MSU', 'Mar 2011 - May 2014', 'Vice President and Webmaster',

"ACM is an international organization that provides resources to students in
Computer Science and related fields. As a founding member of the MSU chapter, I
helped to organize student events including technology talks and seminars with
local tech companies, programming contests, and hackathons. I also gave several
presentations about programming and the field of computer science in general.", 'Community')


experiences << Experience.new('Spectrum Health', 'Sep - Dec 2012', 'Medication Shortages Dashboard',

                              # TODO don't say 'shortages' so much
"Through the senior design program in MSU's computer science department, I worked
with doctors and pharmacists at Spectrum Health to create an \"issue tracker\" for
medication shortages. The web-based tool pulled shortage reports from the FDA and
provided an interface for doctors to discuss the shortages and plan courses of
action for mitigating the effects of the shortages.")


experiences << Experience.new('Microsoft', 'May - July 2012', 'Software Engineering Intern',

"During my three-month internship at Microsoft, I was responsible for developing
a testing framework for third-party printer drivers in Windows 8. I worked with
team members in the Sustainability Engineering department to create a tool that
simplified the verification process for new printer driver submissions.")


experiences << Experience.new('BEACON Lab, MSU', 'Sep 2011 - May 2012', 'Digital Evolution Research',

"The BEACON Lab, based at MSU, studies evolution in a novel way – by observing
evolving computer programs. As a research assistant, I was responsible for
implementing predator behavior – the ability for programs to feed off of one another.
Working closely with a postdoctoral advisor, I implemented and tested the
behavior in C++. The predator-prey features provided the basis for several future
publications.", 'Research')


experiences << Experience.new('MSU', 'Sep - Dec 2011', 'Teaching Assistant: Introduction to Programming',

"As a teaching assistant for the introductory programming course at MSU, I led
lab sections and help room hours. Through grading program submissions and helping
students one-on-one, I spent many hours critiquing programming style.")


experiences << Experience.new('Department of Media & Information, MSU', 'Sep 2010 - May 2011', 'ICT Network Research',

"In my first research position, I helped a team trying to understand the effects
of governmental regulation of ICT networks. Working with a large base of
simulation software, I contributed by creating visualization interfaces for the
simulation data.", 'Research')
