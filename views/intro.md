# Hello! I'm Grace,<br/>and I design and build web applications.

**That's not all I do, of course.**
I love to travel.
I love to write.
I draw, I'm learning to play guitar, and I'm an aspiring photographer.
I love to meet new people with different perspectives.
I love to learn, and I love to teach what I know.

**But you mostly care about the software I build.**
And that's fine.
I take a lot of pride in what I build.
I ship products that are intuitive and effective,
whether it's an application with millions of users,
or just API documentation for another developer on the team.

**Let's get to work.**
