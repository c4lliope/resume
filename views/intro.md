# Hello! I'm Grace,<br/>and I design and build web applications.

**That's not all I do, of course.**
I love to travel.
I love to write.
I draw, I'm learning to play guitar, and I'm an aspiring photographer.
I love to meet new people with different perspectives.
I love to learn, and I love to teach what I know.

**But you mostly care about the software I build.**
And that's fine.
I take a lot of pride in what I build.
I ship products that are intuitive and effective,
whether it's an application with millions of users,
or just API documentation for another developer.

**There's one catch** â€“
I need to be working on something that matters.
I'm dedicated to work that has a social impact,
and live for the moment that real people get value
out of something I've made.
If your team is working on a project
that makes a real difference in real lives,
I'd love to hear from you.
I think we'll get along well.
