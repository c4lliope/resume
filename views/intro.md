# Hello! I'm Grace.

**You'll probably notice** that I don't have experience in food service,
but don't let that turn you off!
I'm a very conscientious person,
a quick learner,
and I go above and beyond to satisfy people.

**I'm looking for a change of pace** from my previous work experience.
I've been in the software industry for a while,
but I prefer work that involves more human-to-human interaction.

**I'm excited for a chance** to learn new skills,
meet new people,
and fill some stomachs while I'm at it.<br/>
Let's get to work!
